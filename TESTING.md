# Testing

This document contains information on how to test Databox. 

# Integration tests 

The main databox repository contains the integration tests for Databox. 
These are in early development but are still useful. Run 

      ./databox-test

These test will build databox and install a driver and app pair to check 
functionality. More work is required but it is a start. 


# Unit tests

Most core components also have unit tests these are language specific. 
See the [core-arbiter](https://github.com/me-box/core-arbiter/tree/master/test) 
for an example.
