### Manifest v2 draft

Manifest general metadata, following [databox-app-server /app/list](https://github.com/me-box/databox-app-server#applist):

- manifest-version: [Number] \(manifest version e.g 0.2.0)
- store-url: [URL] \(the app store this app is published on)
- name: [String] \(one unique word human readable name.)

- image-registry: \(The registry url default hub.docker.com)
- version: [String] \([semver](http://semver.org/) the version of the image to install e.g 0.3.0 or latest)
- databox-type: [String] \(top-level type field to distinguish apps from drivers)
- description: [Description](#description) \(this includes the multi-layered notice on the purpose of processing)
- ratings: [Array of [Rating](#rating)]
- author: [[Person](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors)]
- license: [[License](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#license)]
- tags: [Array of strings]
- homepage: [String]
- src-repository: [[Repository](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#repository)]

Fields specific to App
- export-whitelist: [Array of [Export Destinations](#export-destination)]
- data-export-access: [URL] \(URL that provides access to details of use of exported data)
- risk: [Risk](#risk)

Fields specific to driver
- data-source-types: \(Array of [Datasource](#datasource) offered by this driver)
- data-schemas: [Array of [Data](#data)]
- external-services-whitelist: [Array of [external-whitelist](#external-whitelist)]  \(External hosts that need to be contacted by this driver)
- compliance: [Standards](#standards)

Notes:

- what markup should be allowed/assumed/required for human-readable UI strings, e.g. [Manifest](#manifest) description, [Package](#package) purpose, risks, benefits?
- At some point it should allow different copies of the same app to be run.

### Description

- overview: [String]
- purpose: [Purpose](#purpose)
- risks: [String]
- benefits: [String]


Plus in SLA, not present in Manifest:

- enabled: [Boolean] \(default false)

### Purpose

The multi-layered notice providing descriptions of the purpose of data processing

- short: [String]
- condensed: [String]
- full: [String]

### Datasource (app only)

An array of datasources to be accessed by an application.

Manifest Object with:

- type: [String] \(basis for compatibility test, like current data store / node type names)
- clientid: [String] used by the app to distinguish datasources of the same type (e.g. 'main-bulb')
- granularities: [Array of [Granularity](#granularity)]
- required: [Boolean]
- minimum: [Number] \(minimum required number of this sensor type, defaults to 1),
- maximum: [Number] \(maximum required number of this sensor type, defaults to 1, -1 for no upper limit)
- guidance:  notes from developer on suitable sensors (i.e. needs to be in kitchen, or next to radiator, partially submerged etc)

#### Granularity

"Granularity" of allowed access to the data source.
May have different facets, but initially considering only time. See also HotNets 2016 submission.
The presumption is that at courser granularity the app is being provided with statistics of the underlying data. For time-series numerical data this would normally be minimum, maximum, average and count (of samples).

Object with:

For time-series data sources:

- maximum-sample-interval: [[duration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration)]

Needed in Manifest (only):

- required: [Boolean]

Plus in SLA, not present in Manifest:

- enabled: [Boolean] \(default false)
- minimum-sample-interval: [[duration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration)] \(minimum allowed)

Notes:

- We should probably propose some preferred sample intervals for consistency between apps/data sources, e.g. [duration](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration) PT1S, PT1M, PT5M, PT1H, P1D, P7D, P1M, P3M, P1Y

### Export Destination (App only)

An JSON object formatted as follows.

    {
        'url': SOME_HTTPS_URL,
        'description': "Human readable description"
    }

Here, the URL is an HTTPs URL to an external server that an app may export data to. This must be full URL that is matched exactly. Once approved by a user, an app can query the `\export` enpoint on the Databox export service (documented [here](https://github.com/me-box/databox-export-service#api)) to emit results to a remote host.


### External Service Whitelist (Driver only)

An array of JSON object formatted as follows.

    {
        'url': SOME_HTTPS_URL,
        'description': "Human readable description"
    }


## Permissions

The standard caveats will be (based on part on [arbiter spec](https://github.com/me-box/databox-arbiter)) as are listed [here](token-auth.md).

### Data

- schema: [[jsonschema](json-schema.org)]
- description: [String] \(any additional useful info on the data generated by this driver - e.g if lumens, could be a table of descriptions ("sunny", "cloudy day") against ranges of values)

### Standards

- id: [String] \(standards identifier eg ISOxyz)
- name: [String] \(human readable name)
- URL: [URL] \(url pointing to standard)

### Risk

- aggregate: [Number]
- breakdown: [Array of [RiskItem](#RiskItem)]

### RiskItem

A risk item refers to a specific risk (e.g. exports data off the box).  To help users we class risk into one of several types: social (e.g accesses sensitive info), technical (e.g. uses unverified code, actuates a physical object) and privacy (e.g. exports data outside the EU)

- score : [Number] \(risk score, 1-5)
- description: [String] \(description of risk)
- type: [social | technical | privacy]

### Rating

- user: [String] \(username or identifier)
- rating: [Number] \(rating out of 5)
- reason: [String] \(reason for rating)
